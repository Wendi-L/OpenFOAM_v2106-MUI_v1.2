This is a test case for coupling two instances through MUI of laplacianFoam

This example case does the following:

    1. Runs two instances of laplacianFoam simultaneously, each using 2 MPI process locally.
    2. Each instance is considered to be a seperate domain (named domain1 and domain2 respectively).
    3. Two 3D MUI coupling interfaces are created (interface_1 and interface_2) and each solver connects to them at the start using the createCouplings.H file.
    4. When the main control object is instantiated by each laplacianFoam solver, a single data value is pushed and fetched through each interface and the result printed to the console.
    5. All console output is placed into files in the “Logs” folder.

There are a number of scripts in the base of the case to ease running:

    1. Allclean: This completely cleans the cases in the case folders.
    2. AllrunCoupled: This completely cleans, executes the coupled case (using mpirun) and postprocesses the cases in each case folder.

The coupling control dictionaries are located at system/couplingDict (this is described in greater detail in the README-MUI document in the base of the repository).
